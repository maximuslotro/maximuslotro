### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p align="center">
  I'm a passionate hobbyist programmer that specializes in Minecraft modding. I live to take on challenges, feel free to reach out to me if you have a project you think I could work on!
</p>

- I ported [ForgeEssentials](https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentials) to [1.16.5](https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentials/tree/1.16.5/develop), it took 15 months and 1000+ hours
  -  I also re-ported it to [1.8.9](https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentials/tree/1.8.9/initial) from [1.7.10](https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentials/tree/1.7.10/develop), to bring it into parity with the LTS versions (1.7.10, 1.12.2, 1.16.5)
- I am currently working on a Minecraft Lord of the Rings mod called Lotr Renewed Extended [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lotr-renewed-extended) [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/lotr-renewed-extended)
  - The team organization can be found here [LotrExtendedTeam](https://github.com/LotrExtendedTeam)
  - Links associated with Renewed Extended:
    - Localisation Repo [LotrExtendedTeam/Extended-Localisation](https://github.com/LotrExtendedTeam/Extended-Localisation)
    - Static Wiki Repo [LotrExtendedTeam/Extended-Wiki](https://github.com/LotrExtendedTeam/Extended-Wiki), and the Wiki [Website](https://lotrextendedteam.github.io/Extended-Wiki/)
